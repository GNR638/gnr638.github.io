                <h2>Course Description</h2>
                <p>Remote sensing systems have become essential for understanding our planet, with applications in climate science, environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, disaster response, and national security. This course teaches the principles and practical use of modern machine learning methods to address these challenges, and students will learn how deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers are designed, trained, and adapted for both natural-world and remote sensing data. The course covers end-to-end learning for key tasks such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and image captioning, and introduces generative modeling techniques including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models. It also teaches advanced learning paradigms such as domain adaptation, generalization, meta-learning, self-supervised learning, representation learning, and multimodal learning, which are critical for building robust models under limited labels and shifting data distributions. The course has both a theoretical and application-focused emphasis, and through case studies, students will gain the conceptual understanding and methodological tools needed to develop scalable and effective machine learning systems for remote sensing and related real-world applications.</p>
